Processed GESTALT barcodes from serially sampled sperm data.
Your job completed at 01:56 PM on 11/11/2024

############################################################################################

Summary of step A: Throw out whole files that have low total reads and write passed-samples-info.csv.

Your data contains 93 .allReadCounts files, or 93 samples including replicates.

If a file contained at least999 total reads across all barcodes, then it has passed this filter step.

4 files failed this step:
fish1_s9_rep2 failed with only 551 total reads. 
fishctrl3_s4_rep2 failed with only 4 total reads. 
fishctrl3_s4_rep3 failed with only 21 total reads. 
fishctrl3_s4_rep1 failed with only 8 total reads. 

89 files passed the filter.

The contents of those passing files were copied to a new file with the extension name '.passReadCounts' 
in the same subfolder.

The passed-samples-info.csv was also written and saved to the folder called data.
It contains only samples that pass this step.

############################################################################################

Summary of step B: Filter barcodes by reads and proportion cutoffs.

For each .passReadCounts file, if a barcode had fewer than 10 reads or a proportion below 0.005,
it was removed from the file.

Passing barcodes for each sample were written to a sample file with the extension: .filteredReadCounts

A list of barcodes that were removed was written to a sample file that ends with 'stepB_removed_barcodes.txt'
This may be useful to verify that the changes from .passReadCounts to .filteredReadCounts were accurate.

Summary of step C: Examine questionable barcodes and identify contaminant barcodes.

A fish dictionary was created for each fish in your data and written to a file like fish1_dictionary.tsv 

A dictionary holds every barcode found in any sample or replicate belonging to that animal.
For each barcode in that dictionary, information about:
	1) the sample replicate it showed up in,
	2) the proportion of that sample replicate's barcode population
	3) the number of reads associated with that barcode within the sample replicate
All dictionaries were also compiled into one file called fishes_dictionaries.tsv.

The fish dictionaries were used to compare barcode occurrence across fish.
Questionable barcodes are barcodes that show up in multiple fish.
This list was written to questionable_barcodes_list.txt.

The rest of this step is exploring those questionable barcodes. The next set of filtered files
are generated in Step D.

Here is an example fish dictionary:

Summary of step D: Remove contaminant barcodes from their read files.

The barcodes in questionable barcodes list were examined carefully for their presence across animals.
If a clear source of that barcode could be found, the questionable barcode was assigned a source fish.
If there was not a clear winner, the questionable barcode was considered contaminant everywhere.

For each questionable barcode, it was removed from the .filteredReadCounts files where it is considered contamination.
The new read files are written with the extension: .filteredQualityReadCounts


Here is a recap of how the .filteredReadCounts files were changed: 

No barcodes removed from fish1_s3_rep1.filteredReadCounts. 

No barcodes removed from fish1_s3_rep2.filteredReadCounts.

Summary of step E: A barcode matrix file is written to the experiments folder and
is used for generating Muller plots.

A barcode matrix file is also written for each fish in your samples.
The barcodes present in these matrix files will have passed all three filters (steps A, B and D)
