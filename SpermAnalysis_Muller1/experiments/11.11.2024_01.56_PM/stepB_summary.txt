Summary of step B: Filter barcodes by reads and proportion cutoffs.

For each .passReadCounts file, if a barcode had fewer than 10 reads or a proportion below 0.005,
it was removed from the file.

Passing barcodes for each sample were written to a sample file with the extension: .filteredReadCounts

A list of barcodes that were removed was written to a sample file that ends with 'stepB_removed_barcodes.txt'
This may be useful to verify that the changes from .passReadCounts to .filteredReadCounts were accurate.

Here is a recap of the filtering for each sample:
