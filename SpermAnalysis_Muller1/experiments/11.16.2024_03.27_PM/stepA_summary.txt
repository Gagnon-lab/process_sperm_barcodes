Summary of step A: Throw out whole files that have low total reads and write passed-samples-info.csv.

Your data contains 93 .allReadCounts files, or 93 samples including replicates.

If a file contained at least999 total reads across all barcodes, then it has passed this filter step.

4 files failed this step:
fish1_s9_rep2 failed with only 551 total reads. 
fishctrl3_s4_rep2 failed with only 4 total reads. 
fishctrl3_s4_rep3 failed with only 21 total reads. 
fishctrl3_s4_rep1 failed with only 8 total reads. 

89 files passed the filter.

The contents of those passing files were copied to a new file with the extension name '.passReadCounts' 
in the same subfolder.

The passed-samples-info.csv was also written and saved to the folder called data.
It contains only samples that pass this step.
